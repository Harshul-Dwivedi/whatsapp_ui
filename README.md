A whatsapp ui clone that contains the main chat list screen and the individual chat screen interface.

## Getting Started

Created the app using flutter and dart and the mock data was  taken from  the internet.
Responsive Layout was used so that the app is able to run on various screen sizes such as phone and web.
Constant files were created that contains global info used throughout the app.
Various custom widgets were created separately so that they can be used again over the codebase and thus reduces redundancy.
